# SpaceShooter

## Background
Space Shooter is an Astroids style game based on the Unity Space Shooter tutorial. This work is an attempt to take the tutorial several steps further by implementing a proper UI as well as adding more enemies and additional game mechanics.

## Installation
SpaceShooter requires the user to have a working installation of Unity.
Always find the latest version on: ```https://unity3d.com/get-unity```

Once you have the editor up on running you can use clone the repository into an empty project and run it from the editor.

## Controls
The game has been designed for the iOS mobile platform and as such plays best using the appropriate resolution.
Because of this mobile design the game utilizes touch fields in the bottom left and right corners to facilitate movement and firing controls.

When running the game from the editor it is also possible to use the ```WASD``` or arrow keys to move and the ```ctrl``` key to shoot.
